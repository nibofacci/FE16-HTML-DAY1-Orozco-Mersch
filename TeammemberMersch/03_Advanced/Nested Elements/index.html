    <!--Create a planner for activities to do in Vienna over the weekend. 

    You will need 3 rows and 3 columns. The first row will contain the headings Day, Morning and Afternoon.

    The second row contains all the information for Saturday. Place descriptive lists within each of the two 
    
    empty table cells(the cells for the morning and afternoon).


    For Sunday, use ordered lists to rank your activities. Within the ordered lists you should nest unordered 
    
    lists with more information on each activity you plan.-->
